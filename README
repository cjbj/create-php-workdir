create-php-workdir
------------------

A simple, ugly, faulty script to create PHP working dirs. Prerquirements:
  - git-new-workdir in $PATH
  - A clone of the PHP source tree in `pwd`/php-src

If this script is then invoked like

    $ ./create-php-workdir

it will use git-new-workdir to create a directory called php-5.3 to hold
the source of the PHP-5.3 branch and run buildconf in there.

Then it will create a bunch of build dirs:
   build/5.3/debug-notsrm
   build/5.3/debug-tsrm
   build/5.3/nodebug-notsrm
   build/5.3/nodebug-tsrm

Which contain configure and config.nice files ready to build different
configurations of PHP.

Mind that the script does only little error checking and such so be careful.
